# High Performance Computing: Feng's Classification Model
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

Feng's Classification Model is a method used in High Performance Computing (HPC) to categorize and evaluate the performance of computing systems. This model was introduced by Wu Feng and focuses on the efficiency and effectiveness of a computing system by considering the balance between the computational capability and the data movement capability.

## Details:

### **1. Feng's Classification Model**

The Feng's Classification Model is a performance classification model that is used to compare and evaluate the performance of different computing systems. It focuses on the balance between computational capability (how fast a system can perform computations) and data movement capability (how fast a system can move data).

This model is represented as a two-dimensional graph, where the x-axis represents the computational capability and the y-axis represents the data movement capability. Each point on the graph represents a computing system, and the position of the point indicates the balance between its computational and data movement capabilities.

#### **1.1 Computational Capability**

Computational capability refers to the speed at which a system can perform computations. It is measured in FLOPS (Floating Point Operations Per Second). Higher FLOPS indicates a higher computational capability.

#### **1.2 Data Movement Capability**

Data movement capability refers to the speed at which a system can move data. It is measured in bytes per second (B/s). Higher B/s indicates a higher data movement capability.

### **2. Importance of Balance**

The balance between computational capability and data movement capability is crucial in high performance computing. A system with high computational capability but low data movement capability will spend most of its time waiting for data to be moved, resulting in low overall performance. Similarly, a system with high data movement capability but low computational capability will spend most of its time waiting for computations to be performed, resulting in low overall performance.

Therefore, in order to achieve high performance, a computing system must have a balance between its computational capability and data movement capability.

### **3. Use of Feng's Classification Model**

Feng's Classification Model is used to compare and evaluate the performance of different computing systems. By plotting the computing systems on the graph, one can easily see which systems have a good balance between computational and data movement capabilities, and which systems are unbalanced. This can help in selecting the most suitable computing system for a particular task.

### **4. Example**

Consider two computing systems A and B. System A has a computational capability of 1000 FLOPS and a data movement capability of 1000 B/s. System B has a computational capability of 2000 FLOPS and a data movement capability of 500 B/s.

According to Feng's Classification Model, System A has a better balance between computational and data movement capabilities, and is therefore likely to have a higher overall performance than System B.
