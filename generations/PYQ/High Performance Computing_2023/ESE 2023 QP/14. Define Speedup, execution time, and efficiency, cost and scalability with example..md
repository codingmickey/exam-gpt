# High Performance Computing: Speedup, Execution Time, Efficiency, Cost and Scalability
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

High Performance Computing (HPC) is a field that focuses on aggregated computing performance that is far beyond the capabilities of a typical desktop computer. In this context, we will discuss the following key concepts:

1. **Speedup**: The performance improvement gained by solving a problem on a parallel computing system compared to a sequential system.
2. **Execution Time**: The time taken to complete a task or program.
3. **Efficiency**: The effectiveness of a computer system in terms of the time, effort, or cost spent relative to the results obtained.
4. **Cost**: The total resources that are consumed or used by a computation.
5. **Scalability**: The ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work.

## Details:

### 1. Speedup

**Speedup (S)** is a measure of the effectiveness of a parallel system in reducing the computation time of a problem compared to a sequential system. It is calculated as the ratio of the execution time of the best sequential algorithm (T1), to the execution time of the parallel algorithm on p processors (Tp).

Speedup Formula:
```
S = T1 / Tp
```
Where:
- T1 is the execution time of the best sequential algorithm.
- Tp is the execution time of the parallel algorithm on p processors.

#### Example:

If a problem takes 100 hours to solve on a sequential machine and 2 hours on a 64-processor parallel machine, the speedup is 100/2 = 50.

### 2. Execution Time

**Execution Time** is the period from when a task or program is first started to when it is completed. It is typically measured in seconds, milliseconds, or clock cycles.

#### Example:

If a program takes 10 seconds to run on a single processor, the execution time is 10 seconds.

### 3. Efficiency

**Efficiency (E)** is a measure of the utilization of computing resources to solve a problem. It is calculated as the ratio of the speedup to the number of processors (p).

Efficiency Formula:
```
E = S / p
```
Where:
- S is the speedup.
- p is the number of processors.

#### Example:

If the speedup of a program on a 64-processor machine is 50, the efficiency is 50/64 = 0.78 or 78%.

### 4. Cost

**Cost** in the context of HPC refers to the total amount of resources consumed or used by a computation. This includes the computational resources (like CPU time), memory, storage, energy, and so on.

#### Example:

If a computation requires 2 hours of CPU time, 1GB of memory, and 10GB of storage, these contribute to the overall cost of the computation.

### 5. Scalability

**Scalability** refers to the ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. In HPC, we often discuss two types of scalability:

- **Strong Scalability**: Keeping the problem size fixed and increasing the number of processors. The goal is to solve a problem as fast as possible.
- **Weak Scalability**: Increasing the problem size along with the number of processors such that the problem size per processor remains constant. The goal is to solve larger problems.

#### Example:

A parallel system that can effectively utilize an increasing number of processors to solve larger problems or solve problems faster is considered to have good scalability.
