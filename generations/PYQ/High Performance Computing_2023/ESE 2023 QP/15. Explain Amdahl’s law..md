# High Performance Computing: Amdahl's Law
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

Amdahl's law is a formula which is used to find the maximum improvement possible by an improvement of a computation. The law is named after computer architect Gene Amdahl, and is used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical maximum speedup using multiple processors.

Amdahl's law is often used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical speedup when using multiple processors. For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular portion of the program which takes one hour to execute cannot be parallelized, while the remaining 19 hours of execution time can be parallelized, how much speedup can we achieve with an infinite number of processors?

## Details:

Amdahl's law can be formulated as follows:

**Speedup(S) = 1 / (1 - P + P/N)**

where:
- **S** is the speedup of the program using the parallel computing infrastructure.
- **P** is the portion of the program that can be made parallel (i.e., benefit from parallelization).
- **N** is the number of processors.

### Key Points to Remember:
1. If a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular portion of the program which takes one hour to execute cannot be parallelized, while the remaining 19 hours of execution time can be parallelized, then P would be 19/20 and (1 - P) would be 1/20 or 0.05.
2. As N tends to infinity, the maximum speedup tends to 1 / (1 - P). So, the speedup of a program using parallel computing infrastructure is limited by the time needed for the sequential fraction of the program. 
3. For example, if 95% of the program can be parallelized, the theoretical maximum speedup using parallel computing would be 20 times, no matter how many processors are used.

### Limitation of Amdahl's Law:
Amdahl's law only provides a theoretical maximum speedup, and assumes that there is perfect load balancing with no overhead from parallelization, which is not the case in real-world scenarios. The actual speedup would be less than the theoretical maximum.

In conclusion, Amdahl's law is a basic tool for understanding how much a computational task might benefit from parallelization. However, it is a simple model and does not take into account the complex realities of parallel computing, such as communication and synchronization overhead, and uneven load distribution.
