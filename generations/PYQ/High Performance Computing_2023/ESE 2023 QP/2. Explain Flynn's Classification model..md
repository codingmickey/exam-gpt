# High Performance Computing: Flynn's Classification Model
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

Flynn's Classification model is a system used to categorize computer architectures based on the number of data sources and instruction streams they can process simultaneously. It was proposed by Michael J. Flynn in 1966 and is widely used in the field of high performance computing. The model classifies computer architectures into four categories: Single Instruction Single Data (SISD), Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD), Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD), and Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD).

## Details:

### 1. Single Instruction Single Data (SISD)

In SISD architecture, a single processor executes a single instruction stream to manipulate data stored in a single memory. This is the most basic type of computing architecture and is commonly seen in traditional sequential computers.

```markdown
- **Single Instruction**: Only one instruction stream is being acted on by the CPU during any one clock cycle.
- **Single Data**: Only one data stream is being used as input during any one clock cycle.
```

### 2. Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)

In SIMD architecture, a single instruction stream is used to manipulate multiple data streams simultaneously. This type of architecture is used in computers that need to perform the same operation on large quantities of data, such as in image and signal processing.

```markdown
- **Single Instruction**: Only one instruction stream is being acted on by the CPU during any one clock cycle.
- **Multiple Data**: Multiple data streams are being used as input during any one clock cycle.
```

### 3. Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD)

In MISD architecture, multiple instruction streams are used to manipulate a single data stream. This is a rarely used architecture as it's not often that a single data stream would need to be manipulated by multiple instructions simultaneously.

```markdown
- **Multiple Instruction**: Multiple instruction streams are being acted on by the CPU during any one clock cycle.
- **Single Data**: Only one data stream is being used as input during any one clock cycle.
```

### 4. Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD)

In MIMD architecture, multiple processors operate on multiple data streams simultaneously, each processor executing its own instruction stream. This type of architecture is used in parallel computing where tasks are broken down and distributed across multiple processors.

```markdown
- **Multiple Instruction**: Multiple instruction streams are being acted on by the CPU during any one clock cycle.
- **Multiple Data**: Multiple data streams are being used as input during any one clock cycle.
```

| Flynn's Classification | Instruction | Data |
|------------------------|-------------|------|
| SISD                   | Single      | Single |
| SIMD                   | Single      | Multiple |
| MISD                   | Multiple    | Single |
| MIMD                   | Multiple    | Multiple |

In conclusion, Flynn's Classification model is a fundamental concept in high performance computing, providing a framework to understand and categorize different computer architectures based on their data and instruction processing capabilities.
