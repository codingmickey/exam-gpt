# High Performance Computing: MPI Routines
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

**MPI (Message Passing Interface)** is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computing architectures. MPI routines are the functions provided by MPI libraries to enable parallel programming and communication between different processes in a distributed memory system. 

Key routines include MPI_Init, MPI_Comm_size, MPI_Comm_rank, MPI_Send, MPI_Recv, and MPI_Finalize.

## Details:

### 1. **MPI_Init**

- MPI_Init is the first MPI routine that should be called in every MPI program. 
- It initializes the MPI execution environment and must be called before any other MPI routine.

```cpp
int MPI_Init(int *argc, char ***argv)
```

### 2. **MPI_Comm_size**

- MPI_Comm_size determines the number of processes in a communicator.
- It returns the total number of MPI processes in the specified communicator group.

```cpp
int MPI_Comm_size(MPI_Comm comm, int *size)
```

### 3. **MPI_Comm_rank**

- MPI_Comm_rank determines the rank of the calling process in the communicator.
- It returns the rank of the calling process in the specified communicator group.

```cpp
int MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_Comm comm, int *rank)
```

### 4. **MPI_Send**

- MPI_Send performs a basic send operation. 
- It sends data from the calling process to another process.

```cpp
int MPI_Send(void* buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm)
```

### 5. **MPI_Recv**

- MPI_Recv performs a basic receive operation. 
- It receives data that has been sent to the calling process.

```cpp
int MPI_Recv(void* buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int source, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status)
```

### 6. **MPI_Finalize**

- MPI_Finalize is the last MPI routine that should be called in every MPI program.
- It cleans up the MPI environment and must be called before the program exits.

```cpp
int MPI_Finalize(void)
```

## Table Summary:

| MPI Routine | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| MPI_Init | Initializes the MPI execution environment |
| MPI_Comm_size | Determines the number of processes in a communicator |
| MPI_Comm_rank | Determines the rank of the calling process in the communicator |
| MPI_Send | Performs a basic send operation |
| MPI_Recv | Performs a basic receive operation |
| MPI_Finalize | Cleans up the MPI environment |

**Note:** The above mentioned are basic MPI routines. There are many more advanced routines available in the MPI library for complex parallel programming tasks.
