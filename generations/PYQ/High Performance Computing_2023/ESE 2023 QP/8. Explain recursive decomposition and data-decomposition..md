# High Performance Computing: Recursive Decomposition and Data-Decomposition
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

High Performance Computing (HPC) is a practice that leverages supercomputers and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. HPC technology focuses on developing parallel processing algorithms and systems by incorporating both administration and parallel computational techniques. 

In the context of HPC, **Recursive Decomposition** and **Data-Deccomposition** are two important concepts, which are widely used to break down a large computational problem into smaller tasks that can be solved concurrently. 

- **Recursive Decomposition:** It is a method where a problem is solved by breaking it down into sub-problems of the same type, which are further broken down to more manageable levels. 

- **Data-Decomposition:** It is a method where the data associated with a problem is divided into smaller chunks of data, and each chunk is processed independently.

## Details:

### Recursive Decomposition

Recursive Decomposition is a divide-and-conquer approach to solve a problem. It involves the following steps:

1. **Divide:** The problem is divided into one or more smaller sub-problems of the same type.
2. **Conquer:** The sub-problems are solved recursively. If they are small enough, they are solved directly.
3. **Combine:** The solutions of the sub-problems are combined to get the solution to the original problem.

This method is useful when the problem can be easily broken down into similar sub-problems. It also allows for high levels of parallelism, as the sub-problems can often be solved concurrently.

### Data-Decomposition

Data-Decomposition is a method where the data associated with a problem is divided into smaller chunks, and each chunk is processed independently. This involves the following steps:

1. **Decompose:** The data set is divided into smaller chunks.
2. **Assign:** Each chunk of data is assigned to a separate processor.
3. **Compute:** Each processor works on its assigned chunk of data.
4. **Gather:** The results from each processor are gathered and combined to form the final result.

This method works best when the computations on each chunk of data can be performed independently. It allows for high levels of parallelism as each chunk of data can be processed concurrently.

Data-decomposition is a common strategy in high-performance computing applications, especially those that deal with large data sets. It allows for efficient use of multiple processors, as each processor can work on a different chunk of data at the same time.

In summary, both recursive decomposition and data-decomposition are important concepts in high performance computing, providing different strategies for breaking down complex problems and allowing for efficient parallel processing.
