# High Performance Computing: Message Passing Operations
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

In High Performance Computing, message passing operations play a crucial role in inter-process communication. The two major types of message passing operations are:

1. Buffered Blocking Message Passing Operation
2. Non-Buffered Blocking Message Passing Operation

These operations are fundamental to understanding parallel programming and distributed systems. They allow processes to communicate and synchronize their actions without the need for shared memory.

## Details:

### **1. Buffered Blocking Message Passing Operation**

- **Definition:** In Buffered Blocking Message Passing, the sender process sends a message to the buffer and continues with its own execution. The message stays in the buffer until the receiver process receives it. The sender does not wait for the receiver to receive the message, hence it is called blocking.

- **Advantages:**
  - It allows for overlap between communication and computation. The sender can continue its computation after sending the message.
  - It can handle large messages without slowing down the sender process.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - It requires extra memory to store the message in the buffer.
  - It can lead to buffer overflow if the buffer is full and the sender tries to send another message.

### **2. Non-Buffered Blocking Message Passing Operation**

- **Definition:** In Non-Buffered Blocking Message Passing, the sender process sends a message and waits until the receiver process receives it. Since the sender is blocked until the receiver receives the message, it is called blocking.

- **Advantages:**
  - It does not require extra memory as there is no buffer.
  - It ensures that the message is received by the receiver before the sender continues its execution.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - It does not allow for overlap between communication and computation. The sender cannot continue its computation until the receiver receives the message.
  - It can slow down the sender process if the receiver takes a long time to receive the message.

### Comparison Table

|   | Buffered Blocking | Non-Buffered Blocking |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | Sender sends message to buffer and continues execution | Sender sends message and waits for receiver |
| Memory Requirement | Requires extra memory for buffer | Does not require extra memory |
| Overlap | Allows overlap between communication and computation | Does not allow overlap |
| Speed | Can handle large messages without slowing down sender | Can slow down sender if receiver takes long time |

## Summary:

Both Buffered Blocking and Non-Buffered Blocking Message Passing Operations have their own advantages and disadvantages. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the communication and computation tasks in the high performance computing application.
