# High Performance Computing: Exploratory Decomposition Technique
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

Exploratory Decomposition is a technique used in High Performance Computing (HPC) to break down a large computational task into smaller, manageable tasks. This allows for parallel processing, where multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously on different processors, thereby increasing the efficiency and speed of computation. 

Exploratory Decomposition is particularly useful in solving complex problems where the data is too large to be processed on a single processor. It involves partitioning the data and the tasks, distributing them across multiple processors, and then combining the results.

## Details:

### 1. **Exploratory Decomposition Technique:**

Exploratory Decomposition is a technique that involves the following steps:

  1. **Partitioning:** This is the first step in the exploratory decomposition technique. The large computational task is divided into smaller sub-tasks. Similarly, the data is also partitioned into smaller chunks.

  2. **Distribution:** The smaller tasks and data chunks are then distributed across multiple processors. Each processor is assigned a specific task and a specific data chunk.

  3. **Execution:** Each processor executes its assigned task simultaneously. This is the parallel processing stage.

  4. **Combining:** Once all the processors have completed their tasks, the results are combined to get the final output.

### 2. **Example of Exploratory Decomposition Technique:**

Let's consider an example where we have to calculate the sum of a large array of numbers. 

  1. **Partitioning:** We divide the array into smaller sub-arrays. For instance, if we have an array of 1000 numbers, we can divide it into 10 sub-arrays of 100 numbers each.

  2. **Distribution:** We distribute these sub-arrays to 10 different processors.

  3. **Execution:** Each processor calculates the sum of its assigned sub-array simultaneously.

  4. **Combining:** The sums calculated by each processor are then added together to get the final sum of the array.

By using the exploratory decomposition technique, we can significantly reduce the computation time. Instead of calculating the sum of 1000 numbers sequentially, we calculate the sum of 100 numbers on 10 different processors simultaneously. 

This technique is not limited to summing numbers, but can be applied to any computational task that can be broken down into smaller, independent tasks.

In summary, the Exploratory Decomposition Technique is a powerful tool in High Performance Computing for solving large-scale problems efficiently and quickly.
