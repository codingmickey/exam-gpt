# High Performance Computing: Recursive Decomposition Technique 
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

Recursive Decomposition is a technique used in High Performance Computing (HPC) to break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems. This method involves dividing the problem into two or more smaller problems and solving them recursively until the problem becomes simple enough to be solved directly. This technique is useful in parallel computing where the goal is to solve complex problems faster by dividing them into smaller tasks that can be executed simultaneously.

## Details:

### **1. Understanding Recursive Decomposition:**

Recursive Decomposition is a divide-and-conquer strategy that is widely used in parallel computing. The main idea behind this technique is to divide the problem into smaller sub-problems, solve them independently, and then combine the solutions to solve the original problem. This technique is particularly effective when the sub-problems are independent and can be solved in parallel.

### **2. Working of Recursive Decomposition:**

The working of Recursive Decomposition can be understood in three steps:

- **Divide:** The original problem is divided into one or more sub-problems.
- **Conquer:** Each sub-problem is solved independently. If the sub-problem is still too complex, it is further divided into smaller sub-problems and the process continues recursively until the sub-problem is simple enough to be solved directly.
- **Combine:** The solutions of the sub-problems are combined to form the solution of the original problem.

### **3. Example of Recursive Decomposition:**

Consider the problem of calculating the Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The Fibonacci series can be calculated using the recursive decomposition technique as follows:

- **Divide:** Divide the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., calculating the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.
- **Conquer:** Solve the sub-problems independently. If n is less than or equal to 1, return n. Otherwise, recursively calculate the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.
- **Combine:** Add the solutions of the sub-problems, i.e., the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers, to get the nth Fibonacci number.

Here is the pseudo code for calculating the Fibonacci series using Recursive Decomposition:

```
function fibonacci(n)
    if n <= 1
        return n
    else
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
end function
```

In this example, the problem of calculating the nth Fibonacci number is divided into two smaller problems of calculating the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers. These sub-problems are solved recursively and their solutions are combined to get the solution of the original problem.

### **4. Advantages of Recursive Decomposition:**

- It simplifies the problem-solving process by breaking down complex problems into simpler sub-problems.
- It allows for parallel execution of sub-problems, which can significantly improve the performance of the solution.
- It is a versatile technique that can be applied to a wide range of problems.

### **5. Disadvantages of Recursive Decomposition:**

- It can lead to high overhead due to the need to manage multiple sub-problems and combine their results.
- It may not be efficient for problems where the sub-problems are not independent or cannot be solved in parallel.
- It can lead to stack overflow if the depth of recursion is too high.
