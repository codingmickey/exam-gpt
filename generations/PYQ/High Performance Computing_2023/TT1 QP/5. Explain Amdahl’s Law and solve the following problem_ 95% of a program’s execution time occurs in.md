# High Performance Computing: Amdahl's Law
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

Amdahl's Law is a formula which identifies the maximum improvement gained by improving a particular part of a system. In the context of parallel processing, it is used to predict the theoretical maximum speedup in latency of the execution of a task at fixed workload that can be achieved by using P processors.

## Details: 

### Amdahl's Law:

Amdahl's Law is defined as:

\[
S_{\text{latency}}(s) = \frac{1}{(1 - p) + \frac{p}{s}}
\]

where:

- \(S_{\text{latency}}(s)\) is the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task;
- \(s\) is the speedup of the part of the task that benefits from improved system resources;
- \(p\) is the proportion of execution time that the part benefiting from improved resources originally occupied.

### Problem: 

Given: 95% of a programâ€™s execution time occurs inside a loop that can be executed in parallel. The program is to be executed on 8 CPUs.

We need to find the maximum speedup expected from a parallel version of the program.

Using Amdahl's Law:

Let \(p = 0.95\) (since 95% of the program can be parallelized), and \(s = 8\) (since we have 8 CPUs).

Then we substitute these values into Amdahl's Law:

\[
S_{\text{latency}}(s) = \frac{1}{(1 - p) + \frac{p}{s}}
\]

\[
S_{\text{latency}}(8) = \frac{1}{(1 - 0.95) + \frac{0.95}{8}}
\]

Solving this will give us the maximum speedup that can be achieved.

### Note:

- The value of \(p\) should be in the range of 0 to 1. If \(p = 1\), it means that the task can be fully parallelized. If \(p = 0\), it means that the task cannot be parallelized at all.
- The value of \(s\) should be greater than 1. If \(s = 1\), it means that there is no speedup in the execution of the parallelizable part of the task.
- Amdahl's Law assumes that the task is evenly divided among the processors. If the task is not evenly divided, then the speedup will be less than the value calculated using Amdahl's Law.
