# High Performance Computing: Communication Costs in Parallel Machines
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

Communication costs in parallel machines refer to the time and resources required for data exchange between different processing elements. These costs can significantly affect the performance of a parallel system. Understanding these costs is crucial for optimizing parallel algorithms and hardware architectures.

### Key Topics:

1. Latency
2. Bandwidth
3. Impact of Communication Costs
4. Communication Models in Parallel Computing
5. Optimization Techniques for Reducing Communication Costs

## Details:

### 1. Latency

**Latency** is the time taken to send a message from one point to another. It includes the time to prepare the message for transmission (packaging), time taken in the transmission medium, and the time to unpack the message at the receiver end.

```markdown
*Latency = Packaging Time + Transmission Time + Unpackaging Time*
```

### 2. Bandwidth

**Bandwidth** refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time. It is usually measured in bits per second (bps), kilobits per second (Kbps), or megabits per second (Mbps).

```markdown
*Bandwidth = Data Volume / Time*
```

### 3. Impact of Communication Costs

The impact of communication costs on the performance of parallel systems is significant. High communication costs can lead to:

- Increased total execution time
- Lower system efficiency
- Increased energy consumption

### 4. Communication Models in Parallel Computing

There are two main models of communication in parallel computing: **Shared Memory Model** and **Message Passing Model**.

- **Shared Memory Model**: In this model, all processors share a common memory space. When a processor needs to communicate with another processor, it writes data to or reads data from the shared memory.

- **Message Passing Model**: In this model, processors have their own private memory. When a processor needs to communicate with another processor, it sends a message to that processor.

### 5. Optimization Techniques for Reducing Communication Costs

There are several techniques to reduce communication costs in parallel systems, including:

- **Overlap of Computation and Communication**: This technique involves organizing the computation in such a way that some computation can be done while communication is taking place.

- **Aggregation of Small Messages**: This technique involves combining several small messages into a single larger message to reduce the overhead associated with sending each message individually.

- **Use of Collective Communication Operations**: Collective communication operations involve communication between more than two processors. These operations can be more efficient than multiple individual point-to-point communications.

In conclusion, understanding and optimizing communication costs is a key aspect of high performance computing. By reducing these costs, we can make parallel systems more efficient and effective.
