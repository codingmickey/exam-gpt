# OpenMP: A Standard for Directive Based Parallel Programming
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is a standard for parallel programming that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence runtime behavior. OpenMP is a portable, scalable model that provides a flexible interface for developing parallel applications.

## Details:

### **1. Basics of OpenMP:**

OpenMP uses a portable, scalable model that gives programmers a simple and flexible interface for developing parallel applications for platforms ranging from the standard desktop computer to the supercomputer.

- **Parallel Regions:** The fundamental unit of work in OpenMP is a parallel region, which is a block of code that will be executed by multiple threads. This is defined by `#pragma omp parallel`.

- **Work Sharing Constructs:** These are used to specify how the iterations of a loop or the statements in a region are divided among the threads in a team. Examples are `#pragma omp for` and `#pragma omp sections`.

- **Data Scope:** OpenMP uses three data scope attributes - shared, private and firstprivate to define how the data is shared among threads.

### **2. OpenMP Directives:**

OpenMP directives are the core of the OpenMP programming model. They are used to define the parallel regions, the data scope, and the work sharing constructs.

```c
#pragma omp directive-name [clause[ [,] clause] ... ]
structured-block
```

- **Critical Sections:** These are used to ensure that only one thread executes a particular section of code at a time. The syntax is `#pragma omp critical`.

- **Barrier:** A point in the code where all threads should synchronize. The syntax is `#pragma omp barrier`.

- **Ordered:** This directive is used to ensure that the iterations of a loop are executed in the order in which they would be executed in a sequential program. The syntax is `#pragma omp ordered`.

### **3. OpenMP Library Routines:**

OpenMP provides a set of library routines that can be used to control and get information about the execution of parallel regions. These include routines for setting and getting the number of threads, getting the thread id, etc.

### **4. OpenMP Environment Variables:**

OpenMP uses environment variables to control the execution of parallel regions. These include `OMP_NUM_THREADS` (sets the number of threads), `OMP_SCHEDULE` (sets the scheduling policy), etc.

### **5. Advantages of OpenMP:**

- It is a standard, ensuring portability of code.
- It allows incremental parallelism, i.e., parts of a program can be made parallel with little effort.
- It provides a high level of abstraction, hiding many details of thread management and synchronization.

### **6. Disadvantages of OpenMP:**

- It supports only shared memory systems, not distributed memory systems.
- It is less flexible than lower-level programming models like Pthreads.
- There can be hidden race conditions due to the high level of abstraction.

## Example of OpenMP program:

```c
#include <omp.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        int ID = omp_get_thread_num();
        printf("hello(%d)", ID);
        printf(" world(%d) \n", ID);
    }
}
```

In this program, the `#pragma omp parallel` directive creates a team of threads. `omp_get_thread_num()` returns the unique ID of the calling thread.
