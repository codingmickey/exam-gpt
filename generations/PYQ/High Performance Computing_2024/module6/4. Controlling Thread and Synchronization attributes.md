# High Performance Computing: Controlling Thread and Synchronization
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

High Performance Computing (HPC) is a practice of aggregating computing power in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out of a typical desktop computer or workstation. It focuses on running advanced applications reliably, quickly, and efficiently. 

In the context of HPC, Controlling Thread and Synchronization is a crucial topic. It involves managing multiple threads of execution within a single process and coordinating their execution in a way that ensures the integrity of data and enhances the performance of the system.

### Key Topics:
1. Thread Control
2. Synchronization
3. Locks and Barriers
4. Deadlocks and Livelocks

## Details:

### 1. Thread Control
Thread control involves managing the various attributes of a thread, such as its priority, scheduling policy, and stack size.

- **Thread Priority:** Each thread has a priority level, which determines the order in which it is scheduled for execution. Higher priority threads are executed before lower priority threads.
- **Scheduling Policy:** This determines how the operating system schedules threads for execution. Common policies include round-robin, priority-based, and real-time scheduling.
- **Stack Size:** This is the amount of memory allocated for a thread's stack. The stack is used for storing local variables and function call information.

### 2. Synchronization
Synchronization is the coordination of threads to ensure that they work together effectively. It is crucial for maintaining data integrity and avoiding race conditions.

- **Mutexes:** Mutexes (short for "mutual exclusion") are used to protect shared resources from concurrent access by multiple threads. Only one thread can hold a mutex at a time.
- **Condition Variables:** These are used to allow threads to wait until a certain condition is met. They are often used in conjunction with mutexes.
- **Semaphores:** Semaphores are a more general synchronization mechanism that can be used to control access to multiple instances of a resource.

### 3. Locks and Barriers
Locks and barriers are two other synchronization mechanisms used in multithreaded programming.

- **Locks:** A lock is a synchronization mechanism that prevents multiple threads from accessing a shared resource simultaneously. A thread must acquire a lock before it can access the resource, and it releases the lock when it is done.
- **Barriers:** A barrier is a synchronization point in a program where threads can synchronize their progress. When a thread reaches a barrier, it waits until all other threads have reached the same barrier.

### 4. Deadlocks and Livelocks
Deadlocks and livelocks are two types of problems that can occur in multithreaded programs.

- **Deadlock:** A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource.
- **Livelock:** A livelock is a situation where two or more threads continually change their state in response to the state of the other threads, without making any progress.

In order to avoid these problems, it is important to carefully design the synchronization and resource allocation strategies in a multithreaded program.
