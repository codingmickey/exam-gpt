# High Performance Computing: Thread Cancellation
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

Thread cancellation is a process in multithreaded programming where a thread is terminated before it has completed its task. In high performance computing, it is a critical aspect of managing concurrent tasks and ensuring the efficient use of resources. There are two main types of thread cancellation: asynchronous cancellation and deferred cancellation.

## Details:

### **1. Asynchronous Cancellation**

Asynchronous cancellation terminates a target thread immediately.

```markdown
- The thread can be cancelled at any moment.
- This is a simple but dangerous way because it can lead to unexpected results.
```

### **2. Deferred Cancellation**

Deferred cancellation allows the target thread to periodically check if it should terminate itself.

```markdown
- The thread needs to check a cancellation point.
- This is a safer way to cancel a thread as it gives control to the thread.
```

### **Thread Cancellation in Pthreads**

Pthreads is a POSIX standard for threads. It provides functions for thread cancellation.

```markdown
- `pthread_cancel(pthread_t thread)`: This function sends a cancellation request to a thread.
- `pthread_setcancelstate(int state, int *oldstate)`: This function sets the cancelability state of the current thread.
- `pthread_setcanceltype(int type, int *oldtype)`: This function sets the cancellation type of the current thread.
```

### **Cancellation Points**

Certain functions in Pthreads are defined as cancellation points. If these functions are called when cancellation is enabled, the thread is terminated.

```markdown
- `pthread_testcancel()`: This function creates a cancellation point in the calling thread.
- Other functions like `read()`, `write()`, `sleep()` etc. are also cancellation points.
```

### **Clean-up handlers**

Clean-up handlers are functions that are called when a thread is cancelled or when it terminates naturally. They are used to free resources that the thread may have acquired during its execution.

```markdown
- `pthread_cleanup_push(void (*routine) (void *), void *arg)`: This function pushes a new clean-up handler onto the clean-up stack of the calling thread.
- `pthread_cleanup_pop(int execute)`: This function pops the clean-up handlers from the clean-up stack and optionally executes them.
```

### **Cancellation State and Type**

A thread's cancellation state and type determine when and how it can be cancelled.

```markdown
- Cancellation state can be either `PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE` or `PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE`.
- Cancellation type can be either `PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS` or `PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED`.
```

### **Example of Thread Cancellation**

Here is an example of how a thread can be cancelled in a Pthreads program.

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void *thread_func(void *arg)
{
    // Do some work here...

    // Check if thread should be cancelled
    pthread_testcancel();

    return NULL;
}

int main()
{
    pthread_t thread;
    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, thread_func, NULL);

    // Cancel the thread
    pthread_cancel(thread);

    pthread_join(thread, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

This program creates a new thread, cancels it, and then waits for it to terminate. The thread checks if it should be cancelled by calling `pthread_testcancel()`.
