# High Performance Computing: POSIX Thread API
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

**POSIX Threads**, or **Pthreads**, is a POSIX standard for threads. The standard defines an API for creating and manipulating threads. With Pthreads, you can create multiple, concurrent execution threads in a single process. Threads created by Pthreads share the same address space, which allows them to access the same variables and data structures. This shared access can lead to problems, which is why Pthreads provides mechanisms for thread synchronization, such as mutexes and condition variables.

## Details:

### 1. Creating and Exiting Threads

**Syntax for creating a thread:**

```c
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);
```
- `pthread_t *thread`: An opaque, unique identifier for the new thread returned by the subroutine.
- `const pthread_attr_t *attr`: An opaque attribute object that may be used to set thread attributes. You can specify a thread attributes object, or NULL for the default values.
- `void *(*start_routine) (void *)`: the C routine that the thread will execute once it is created.
- `void *arg`: A single argument that may be passed to `start_routine`. It must be passed by reference as a pointer cast of type void. NULL may be used if no argument is to be passed.

**Syntax for exiting a thread:**

```c
void pthread_exit(void *retval);
```
- `void *retval`: This is the pointer to the return value.

### 2. Thread Synchronization

There are several ways to synchronize threads, including mutexes, condition variables, and read-write locks.

**Mutexes:**

A mutex is a lock that guarantees three things: 
- Atomicity: Only one thread can lock (or own) a mutex at a time.
- Non-Busy Waiting: If a thread attempts to lock a mutex that's already locked, it will block (i.e., go to sleep).
- Memory Visibility: After a thread unlocks a mutex, other threads can see the results of the memory writes made by that thread.

**Condition Variables:**

A condition variable is a way for threads to communicate with each other by signaling. A thread using a condition variable will block until another thread signals the condition variable.

**Read-Write Locks:**

A read-write lock allows concurrent access for read-only operations, while write operations require exclusive access. This means that multiple threads can read the data in parallel but an exclusive lock is needed for writing or modifying data.

### 3. Thread Attributes

Thread attributes are properties that can be set to affect the behavior of the thread. These attributes include:

- Detached or joinable state
- Scheduling policy and parameters
- Stack size and address
- Stack guard (overflow) size

### 4. Thread Cancellation

Thread cancellation allows one thread to terminate another thread. This is a complex topic because resources (like memory) that the terminated thread was managing may need to be cleaned up.

### 5. Thread-Specific Data

Thread-specific data are data that are unique for each thread. While all threads share data in the process address space, each thread has its own stack variables, and can have its own thread-specific data.

### 6. Real-time Extensions

Real-time systems have requirements that go beyond those of typical systems. Real-time extensions to the POSIX threads API provide scheduling and synchronization mechanisms that support the needs of real-time applications.
