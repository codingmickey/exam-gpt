# High Performance Computing: Thread Basics
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

High Performance Computing (HPC) is a practice that leverages supercomputers and parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. HPC technology focuses on developing parallel processing algorithms and systems by incorporating both administration and parallel computational techniques.

In the context of HPC, a thread is a smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler. Threads are crucial for achieving parallelism in HPC applications.

## Details:

### 1. **What is a Thread?**

  - A thread, also known as a lightweight process, is a separate path of execution within a program.
  - In HPC, threads are used to perform multiple operations simultaneously within a single program to maximize the computational power and efficiency.
  - Each thread within a program shares the same memory space, which allows for efficient communication and data sharing between threads.

### 2. **Types of Threads**

  - **User Threads**: User-level threads are managed without kernel support. Libraries in the user space manage and schedule these threads. Examples include POSIX threads, Java threads etc.

  - **Kernel Threads**: These are supported and managed directly by the operating system. Kernel has full knowledge of all kernel threads and schedules them accordingly.

### 3. **Multithreading Models**

There are three types of multithreading models:

  - **Many-to-One Model**: Multiple user-level threads are mapped to a single kernel thread.
  - **One-to-One Model**: Each user-level thread is mapped to a kernel thread.
  - **Many-to-Many Model**: Allows many user-level threads to be mapped to many kernel threads.

### 4. **Thread Libraries**

Thread libraries provide programmers with an API to create and manage threads. There are two main types:

  - **POSIX Pthreads**: A POSIX standard for threads that is available on many UNIX-based systems.
  - **Windows Threads**: A proprietary thread library for Windows systems.

### 5. **Thread Creation and Termination**

  - **Thread Creation**: In most systems, a new thread is created by a existing thread. The creating thread is referred to as the parent thread, and the newly created thread is referred to as the child thread.

  - **Thread Termination**: A thread can be terminated in several ways. A thread can terminate itself, or it can be terminated by another thread.

### 6. **Benefits of Multithreading**

  - Improved responsiveness: Multithreading can allow an application to remain responsive to input.
  - Resource sharing: Threads share the memory and the resources of the process to which they belong.
  - Economy: It's more economical to create and context-switch threads.
  - Utilization of multiprocessor architectures: The benefits of multithreading can be greatly increased in multiprocessor systems.

### 7. **Challenges with Multithreading**

  - Thread safety: Since threads share the same memory space, the incorrect use of data can lead to conditions like race conditions.
  - Deadlocks: These occur when two threads are each waiting for the other to release a resource.
  - Starvation: This occurs when a thread is constantly denied necessary resources.
  - Thread priority: Incorrect thread priority can lead to priority inversion or priority inheritance issues.

### 8. **Thread Synchronization**

Thread synchronization is defined as a mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent threads do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment known as critical section.

  - **Mutex**: A mutex provides mutual exclusion, either producer or consumer can have the key (mutex) and proceed with their work.
  - **Semaphore**: Semaphore is simply a variable that is non-negative and shared between threads.
  - **Event Counters**: It is a synchronization mechanism which allows threads to wait until a certain condition has occurred.

### 9. **Thread Scheduling**

Thread scheduling is the process of deciding which thread to run when multiple threads are runnable. It is usually handled by the operating system's kernel.
