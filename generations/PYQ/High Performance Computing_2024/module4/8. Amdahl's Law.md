# High Performance Computing: Amdahl's Law
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

**Amdahl's Law** is a formula which is used to find out the maximum improvement achievable by improving a part of a system. It is named after the computer architect Gene Amdahl, and it's widely used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical maximum speedup using multiple processors.

In the context of High Performance Computing, Amdahl's Law is used to determine the maximum improvement gained in system performance from a given improvement in one part of the system. 

## Details:

**Amdahl's Law** is defined as follows:

    Slatency(s) = 1 / ( (1 - p) + (p / s) )

Where:

- Slatency(s) is the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task;
- s is the speedup of the part of the task that benefits from improved system resources;
- p is the proportion of execution time that the part benefiting from improved resources originally occupied.

### Key Points:

1. **Parallel Fraction (p):** This is the proportion of a calculation that is both dependent on and benefits from improved system resources. It's also the part of the task that can be made parallel.
2. **Serial Fraction (1 - p):** This is the portion of a calculation that does not benefit from improved system resources. It's also the part of the task that cannot be made parallel.
3. **Speedup (s):** This is the factor by which a calculation is sped up due to improved resources.

### Example:

Let's consider an example where 75% of the program can be parallelized. The remaining 25% of the program is serial and cannot be parallelized.

- If we have 4 processors, the speedup according to Amdahl's law would be:

    Slatency(4) = 1 / ( (1 - 0.75) + (0.75 / 4) ) = 2.66

- If we have 100 processors, the speedup would be:

    Slatency(100) = 1 / ( (1 - 0.75) + (0.75 / 100) ) = 3.23

Even with 100 processors, the speedup is only around 3.23 times, not 100 times. This is because of the serial part of the program that cannot be parallelized.

### Limitations:

Amdahl's Law assumes that the program is divided into smallest possible tasks which are then executed in parallel. However, in reality, this is not always possible due to the overhead of communication and synchronization between tasks.

### Conclusion:

Amdahl's Law is an important concept in high performance computing, as it helps us understand the theoretical limits of parallelization and guides us in making decisions about hardware and software optimization. However, it's also important to remember that the actual performance gain will likely be less than the theoretical maximum, due to factors such as communication and synchronization overhead.
