# High Performance Computing: Decomposition Techniques
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

**High Performance Computing (HPC)** refers to the practice of aggregating computing power in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out of a typical desktop computer or workstation in order to solve large problems in science, engineering, or business.

**Decomposition techniques** in HPC are methods used to break down a large computational task into smaller, more manageable parts that can be processed simultaneously. This results in significantly reduced computation time, making it a key component in HPC.

## Details:

### **1. Domain Decomposition**

Domain Decomposition refers to the partitioning of a global problem into smaller sub-problems that can be solved independently and then combined to get the solution of the original problem.

```
Example: Consider a 2D grid, it can be divided into four smaller grids. Each grid can be processed separately and the results combined to get the solution for the entire grid.
```

### **2. Functional Decomposition**

In functional decomposition, the focus is on the computation that needs to be performed rather than the data. The problem is divided into tasks, which can be solved independently and concurrently.

```
Example: In a weather forecasting model, different functions like temperature prediction, pressure prediction, and humidity prediction can be performed concurrently.
```

### **3. Data Decomposition**

Data decomposition involves breaking down the data into smaller chunks and processing these chunks concurrently. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets.

```
Example: Consider a large array of data, it can be divided into smaller arrays. Each smaller array can be processed independently.
```

### **4. Hybrid Decomposition**

Hybrid decomposition is a combination of domain, functional, and data decomposition. It offers more flexibility and can lead to more efficient solutions.

```
Example: In a weather prediction model, the entire geographical area (domain) can be divided into smaller regions. For each region, different functions like temperature prediction, pressure prediction, and humidity prediction (functional decomposition) can be performed on different sets of data (data decomposition).
```

### **5. Recursive Decomposition**

In recursive decomposition, a problem is divided into sub-problems of the same type. Each sub-problem is then further divided until the sub-problems are simple enough to be solved directly.

```
Example: In a sorting algorithm like quicksort, the array is divided into smaller arrays (sub-problems) which are sorted independently. This process is repeated until the arrays are small enough to be sorted directly.
```
