# High Performance Computing: Mapping Techniques for Load Balancing
Detailed Explanation:

## Overview:

Load balancing is a critical aspect of High Performance Computing (HPC). It ensures that the workload is evenly distributed across all available computational resources, thereby maximizing throughput, minimizing response time, and avoiding overload. Mapping techniques play a crucial role in achieving effective load balancing.

Mapping techniques for load balancing involve assigning tasks to processors in a way that evenly distributes the workload. The objective is to minimize the total execution time, maximize resource utilization, and maintain system stability.

## Details:

### 1. **Static Mapping**:

Static mapping involves assigning tasks to processors before the execution starts. The mapping does not change during the execution. This method is simple and incurs minimal overhead. However, it does not adapt to changes in the system or workload during execution.

**Example**: Block Mapping, Cyclic Mapping

- **Block Mapping**: In block mapping, the tasks are divided into equal-sized blocks, and each block is assigned to a processor. This method is simple and effective when the tasks are uniform and independent.

- **Cyclic Mapping**: In cyclic mapping, the tasks are assigned to processors in a round-robin fashion. This method is effective when the tasks have varying computational requirements.

### 2. **Dynamic Mapping**:

Dynamic mapping involves assigning tasks to processors during the execution. The mapping can change based on the system state and workload. This method is more complex and incurs more overhead. However, it adapts to changes in the system or workload during execution.

**Example**: Factoring, Randomized Work Stealing

- **Factoring**: In factoring, the tasks are initially assigned using a static mapping. Then, the remaining tasks are assigned based on the processors' workload. This method is effective when the tasks have varying computational requirements and the workload is unpredictable.

- **Randomized Work Stealing**: In randomized work stealing, each processor maintains a queue of tasks. When a processor finishes its tasks, it 'steals' tasks from the queue of another randomly chosen processor. This method is effective when the workload is unpredictable and there is a large number of tasks.

### 3. **Hybrid Mapping**:

Hybrid mapping involves a combination of static and dynamic mapping. This method can adapt to changes in the system or workload while minimizing the overhead.

**Example**: Guided Self-Scheduling

- **Guided Self-Scheduling**: In guided self-scheduling, the tasks are initially assigned using a static mapping. Then, the remaining tasks are assigned dynamically based on the processors' workload. This method is effective when the tasks have varying computational requirements and the workload is unpredictable.

## Load Balancing Metrics:

- **Makespan**: The total time taken to complete all tasks. The objective is to minimize the makespan.

- **Throughput**: The number of tasks completed per unit time. The objective is to maximize the throughput.

- **Resource Utilization**: The percentage of time the processors are busy. The objective is to maximize resource utilization.

- **System Stability**: The ability of the system to handle changes in the workload or system state. The objective is to maintain system stability.

## Conclusion:

Mapping techniques for load balancing are critical for achieving high performance in HPC. The choice of mapping technique depends on the characteristics of the tasks and the workload, the capabilities of the processors, and the objectives of the HPC system. By choosing the appropriate mapping technique, one can effectively balance the load, thereby maximizing performance and resource utilization, and maintaining system stability.
